 * -------------------------------
 *
 * Transformer that behaves like onExceptionResumeNext(Observable o), but propagates
 * a GoogleAPIConnectionException, which was caused by an unsuccessful resolution.
 * This can be helpful if you want to resume with another RxFit Observable when
 * an Exception occurs, but don't want to show the resolution dialog multiple times.
 *
 * An example use case: Fetch fitness data with server queries enabled, but provide
 * a timeout. When an exception occurs (e.g. timeout), switch to cached fitness data.
 * Using this Transformer prevents showing the authorization dialog twice, if the user
 * denys access for the first read. See MainActivity in sample project.
